# Stock-Analysis-in-Visual-Basic-for-Applications

> Use VBA to analyze generated stock market data. Output the changes that occurred in a year and the greatest increases, decreases, and total volume along with their associated tickers.

## Background - Requirements

> This project uses VBA script to analyze stock market data. In developing the script, the [Test Data](./VBA_Script_Test_Sample/alphabetical_testing.xlsm) was used for its smaller sample size.
once the script was developed, it was applied to the [Stock Data](./VBA_Stock_Data/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm) set. The script is meant to loop through all the data and output two sets of information.

See [Test Data ](./VBA_Script_Test_Sample/Testing%20Sample%20VBA%20Script.vbs) vbs file & [Stock Data](./VBA_Stock_Data/Stock%20Data%20Script.vbs) vbs files for scripts.

| Data Set | Description |
|--------------|---------------|
| Summary of the Individual Stock | The script outputs a line for each stock. In this line, it will summarize the stock with its Ticker, Yearly Change (+/-), Percent Change(+/-), and Total Stock Volume |
| Summary of the Greatest Changes & Values | The script outputs a line for 3 stocks; the greatest % increase, the greatest % decrease, and greatest total volume along with the ticker for each stock referenced respectively |

## Notable Items
> - When I was making the loops, I was considering making 2 `For` loops; one for the summarization of each stock and one for the greatest summary. Instead, while the main `For` loop was running, I had an `If` statement running passively to collect the variables needed for the greatest summary. This turned out to make the script more simple and efficient.
> - When creating the script for conditional formatting, my initial approach was to take the range of the values in the column and format it separately from the `For` statement. This turned out to be difficult and I could not find a way of easily manipulating the `Range() Object` without getting some kind of error or even successfully running the code without any output. My second approach was to apply conditional formating in the `For` loop right after the `Cell` had its value applied.
> - When applying the script to the [Stock Data](./VBA_Stock_Data/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm), I started to get overflow errors again. I needed to change the variable types for tracking the lines from `Long` to `Varient` to keep this from happening. I will keep this in mind when making scripts for large data sets in the future.
